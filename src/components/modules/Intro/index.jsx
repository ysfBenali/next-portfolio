      <h3>More about me</h3>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a super curious guy who enjoys the process of learning new things.
        Currently working as a software engineer. I like writing code especially
        in Javascript and React. Fast learner and obsessed with details and
        quality, I am mostly self-taught, and always keeping up with new
        technologies.
      </p>
      <p>I primarily use the following frameworks, tools, and libraries :</p>
      <Tech>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Nodejs</li>
          <li>{'HTML & CSS'}</li>
          <li>React</li>
          <li>TypeScript</li>
          <li>Nextjs</li>
          <li>{'SQL & NoSQL'}</li>
          <li>GraphQL</li>
        </ul>
      </Tech>
      <p>
        So I'm looking for an opportunity to develop my skills, be
        team-oriented, and have a happy workplace, If you are interested in
        hiring a Front-end developer (React/Next), you are in the right place .
